# Bone Fracture Detection ü¶¥

## **Project Overview**
This project is a deep learning-based system designed to detect bone fractures from X-ray images. The model utilizes the **ResNet18** architecture to classify X-rays as either **fractured** or **not fractured**, assisting healthcare professionals in making quick and accurate diagnoses.

---

## **Key Features**
- **Deep Learning Model**: Built on **ResNet18**, a pre-trained Convolutional Neural Network.
- **Binary Classification**: Detects whether an X-ray image shows a **fractured** or **not fractured** bone.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Provides drag-and-drop functionality along with a "Choose File" option.
- **Advanced Visualizations**: Includes performance metrics such as ROC curve, confusion matrix, and training history plots.
- **Real-Time Predictions**: Quickly processes uploaded images and provides confidence scores.
